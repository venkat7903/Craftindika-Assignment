# Description

TodoList is an application that allows users to keep track of their tasks and the status of their work. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS. Users can **add, delete, change the order** of their todos by simple **drag and droping**. **Local Storage** is used to save the state of the todo list so that the list order and changes persist across page reloads. **React dnd toolkit** is utilized to embed drag and drop feature.

For initial todo items, I made a request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. Since changes aren't persisted on the server, I managed CRUD operations locally within the application's state.
